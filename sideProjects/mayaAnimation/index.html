          <h3 id='scenario-design'>Scenario design:</h3>
          <p> Scene 1 is mainly a reference to the actual scene of the test site, and some partial modifications
            have been made according to the actual scene, making it possible to present a complete scene while
            reducing the modelling workload.</p>
          <p>Scene 2 is mainly about the candidates&#39; writing during the listening test, recording the
            content of the listening text, and the main emotion is nervousness.</p>
          <p>Scene 3 mainly serves as a transition while telling the audience that the test is over. There is
            no transition with Scene 2, the test bell rings directly, taking over the tense atmosphere of the
            previous scene.</p>
          <p>Scene four is mainly the end of the examination, candidates relax, you can do some stretching
            action to show relaxation.</p>
          <p>Scene five is mainly candidates in the college entrance examination after the end of the road
            home, recalled their life in high school past, and feel frustrated, high school life is gone, this
            is the most unforgettable moment, most of the video needs to focus on this scene. Firstly, the
            camera shoots the facial expression from a close distance, then with eyes closed and open as a
            transition, recalling two typical scenes: one is discussing the question paper, and the other is
            looking away during the lunch break. Returning to reality, the camera gradually pulls away and films
            the car travelling along, suggesting the promise of the future.</p>
          </p>
          <h3 id='production-reflection'>Production Reflection:</h3>
          <p> Firstly, scene design, after the completion of the production found that the scene design is still
            too much, 30s of time to put 7 scenes is very rush, although to achieve the narrative function, but
            the rhythm is very rushed.</p>
          <p>Second is modelling, in the face wiring this piece of good need to strengthen the practice. In
            the modelling, later according to the actual situation to adjust the wiring around the eyes when the
            wiring is uneven, not smooth enough problem. There is also the problem of not having a good grasp of
            the general shape of Ren&#39;s face, which makes the face look a bit strange. At the same time, this
            time, when partially using the old model material that I built before, the scene and character
            modelling took nearly 40 hours, this point needs to do more practice to speed up.</p>
          <p>Again, the animation, adv helped a lot in this creation, but after rendering the film, I found
            that some places are still stiff, mainly because the animation curve is too smooth in some
            parts.</p>
          <p>Rendering arrangement again, in this production, the rendering work to spend a total of 40 hours
            (Arnold only cpu, if you use the gpu light effect is wrong and slower), and is arranged in the
            modelling and animation after the unified rendering, in the period of time the computer I sent for
            other work. The rendering work needs to be done in parallel with the animation/modelling in the
            subsequent production process.</p>
          <p>Finally, the editing and dubbing, in the middle and later scenes are still too fast-paced and do
            not have enough residual time. The rhythm of the whole film is not very good, especially the
            transition part needs to be more crisp or soothing. In terms of dubbing, after actually importing
            the material, I found that there are still some false, probably because it is too abrupt, and I need
            to follow up and learn.</p>
