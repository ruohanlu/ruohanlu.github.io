                    <p><strong>We need to care about them.</strong></p>
                    <p>In Canada, the major problem of concurrent food insecurity and waste is a growing
                        socio-economic
                        issue that has significantly intensified over the last two decades.</p>
                    <p>Due to our survey, many student said they had to skip meals despite
                        not
                        wanting to, which may also imply a lack of accessibility. This is a sign that
                        existing
                        solutions to this problem aren't adequate enough to address the needs of the majority of
                        those
                        affected. Thus, instead of focusing on food insecurity as a whole, we are focusing on food
                        accessibility. This focus includes food accessibility regarding pricing, dietary
                        accommodations,
                        etc. </p>
                    <h3 id='my-roles'>My Roles</h3>
                    <p>I conducted full-process user-research methodologies (i.e. usability testing, speed-dating
                        protocols, interview protocol creation, competitor analysis processes, affinity diagramming,
                        etc.).
                        I also used design strategies such as prototyping in Figma, rapid sketching exercises,
                        feedback and
                        critiquing techniques, and others.</p>
                    <h2 id='executive-summary'>Executive Summary</h2>
                    <h3 id='goal'>Goal</h3>
                    <p>Ameliorate food accessibility issue starting from empowering students in University of
                        Toronto
                        through more access to healthy, clean foods.</p>
                    <h3 id='solution-1'>Solution</h3>
                    <p>We decided to build a student chef market place to ameliorate the food accessibility issue
                        in
                        University of Toronto. The design is for an all-in-one marketplace for students looking to
                        buy
                        premade meals by other students and sell ready-made meals to other students.</p>

                    <h4 id='user-interviews'>User Interviews</h4>
                    <p>Our team adopts two options for Formative study, which are questionnaires and
                        interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our first round of interviews, I conducted 2 interviews with students to get a better
                        understanding of their feelings towards and experiences with negotiating. I co-wrote our
                        interview
                        script, which encouraged storytelling and guided conversation with participants.</p>

                                    Hamza, who follows Islamic dietary rules, struggles to find diverse and enjoyable
                                    halal food on campus. <!--Limited and repetitive choices, along with concerns about
                                    freshness due to large-scale preparation, highlight the need for more inclusive food

                                <li>Although Hamza can afford to spend $35 daily on food, he often feels guilty when the
                                    meals are unsatisfying and go to waste. <!--Balancing cost, convenience, and quality is
                                    a common struggle for many students, highlighting the need for more affordable,

                            <ul>
                                <li>Hamza often skips meals or chooses less healthy options on campus due to the limited
                                    food choices. He's uncomfortable using food banks, fearing the quality and facing

                        <li>Recent graduates navigating the transition from academia to the workforce need
                            affordable and
                            nutritious food solutions that acknowledge the financial constraints they face, enabling
                            them to
                            maintain a balanced diet and prioritize their career advancement without compromising
                            their

                            toolkit, we relied on users’ Think-Alouds to understand how our design concepts were
                            received.</p>
                    <p><strong>Think-Alouds</strong> are usability sessions where users are given a
                            few tasks
                            to complete, and are asked to think aloud, as a means to navigate an interactive prototype.
                            From
                            this, we were able to gather insights on the usability of the negotiation toolkit.

                            I zoomed in on the numeric information along with the progress information.</p>
                    <p>Also, after in-depth user research, I found that some users want to be able to stop as they
                            go, so
                            I added a separate play button for each workout.</p>-->

                    <p>If we were granted more time and resources, I would have liked to explore and design for other
                        use cases such as other school students and residence at toronto who are not engaged with this
                        program. Our design solutions were targeted at UofT students. However, it would have been
                        interesting to learn more about how to target those with
                        people in the whole city or country.</p>
