          <h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
          <p>In the gym, in addition to the guidance of professional fitness trainers, it is difficult for
            people to be able to obtain effective training guidance through short videos as well as text on the
            Internet. This phenomenon makes it impossible for people to get the expected training results and makes
            it easy for people to get injured. I have conducted a statistical study on people&#39;s fitness
            experience and willingness to work out, and found that people think that there is a demand for the use
            of equipment, scientific fitness programs and diet plans, but there is not a unified, scientific and
            affordable channel to obtain this knowledge. How can we utilize HCI strategies to help people
            effectively access fitness knowledge and help them exercise scientifically?</p>

          <h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
          <h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
          <p>Helping people to exercise effectively by improving knowledge of science-based fitness.</p>
          <h3 id="solution-1">Solution</h3>
          <p>I developed Accompany You Fit, an interactive fitness software for solo fitness or fitness novices
            to help them make a sensible fitness plan and reduce the possibility of injuries during fitness.
          </p>
          <h3 id="the-users">The Users</h3>
          <h4 id="user-interviews">User Interviews</h4>
          <p>After looking over the data from the screener surveys, I narrowed it down to 4 users to interview
            including in-person and remote. To get a better idea of what's working well and what areas need
            improvement in the tool to be designed, I asked them a series of questions about how they organize and
            stay on task.</p>
          <p><em>A few of the survey questions include:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li>How do you usually work out when you go to the gym, and what kind of assistance do you feel you
              need in terms of training when you work out?</li>
            <li>How did you develop your fitness program, and do you think your current program is helping you
              to</li>
            <li>Do you think the gym&#39;s facilities are good enough for your fitness program, and if not, what
              are you doing about it?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>During the interview process, I learned that people don&#39;t want another course-filled app. They
            want the flexibility of an app that will meet the space constraints and facility constraints of
            different gyms so that people can utilize the facilities available at their current gym and satisfy
            their fitness expectations. They also wanted a program that would help them keep track of the intervals
            between sets and rest periods, which would be a useful tool for them.</p>
          <h4 id="target-users">Target Users</h4>
          <p>Novice users who want to work out sensibly and users who work out alone.</p>

          <h3 id="ux-research">UX Research</h3>
          <h4 id="identifying-the-problem">Identifying the problem</h4>
          <p>I conducted a background study by conducting a competitive analysis with other digital negotiation
            tools and completed a heuristic evaluation of the Nike Training Club app. The app provide users with
            various courses like home workouts, mindfulness, yoga and high-intensity training. This app helps users
            progress towards their holistic fitness goals with tools to support their physical and mental
            well-being.</p>

          <h4 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p><img src="/sideProjects/AccompnayYouFit/image/competitiveAnalysis.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

          <h4 id="affinity-and-empathy-mapping">Affinity and Empathy Mapping</h4>
          <p>The next step was to analyze my primary research through Affinity Mapping. I looked through my
            notes and re-listened to the audio recordings from the user interviews to write out key ideas, quotes,
            and any quantitative research onto sticky notes. After laying them all out, I started categorizing them
            into three main themes which were <em>organization</em>,
            <em>integration</em>, and <em>simplicity</em>.
          </p>
          <p>To further put myself in the user's perspective, I created empathy maps using two potential user groups
            which were students and creatives. During this exercise I considered what each of them would think,
            feel, say and do and noted the pains and gains they were having while using current tools.</p>
          <!--<p>With the idea of stepping out of myself further and into their minds and actions, I was able to
            gain an understanding of their frustrations and start thinking about what would be helpful in a new
            product.</p>-->

          <p>To start the design stage, I used speed dating method and gathered participants' reactions to each

          <h5 id="why-a-native-mobile-application">Why a native mobile application?</h5>
          <p>Our team believed that these 3 features could best be implemented by way of a mobile application,
            as people are constantly on the move in gym and need resources that are available during workouts.
            Additionally, we believe that a mobile app will have a larger reach than a web-based solution.

          <h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
          <p>I used Figma to design various screens and key features of our prototype.</p>
          <h3 id="usability-testing-1">Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>We returned to our users for feedback. To test the efficacy and intuitiveness of our mobile
            toolkit, we relied on users' Think-Alouds to understand how our design concepts were received.
          </p>
          <h5 id="workout-instruction"><strong>Workout instruction</strong></h5>
          <p>Originally, I thought users might be monitoring the screen at all times to note their progress, so
            I zoomed in on the numeric information along with the progress information.</p>
          <p>Also, after in-depth user research, I found that some users want to be able to stop as they go, so
            I added a separate play button for each workout.</p>
          <p><strong>Insight from Usability Testing:</strong> While users felt the video
            instructions were helpful they preferred if they have more ways of getting tips. I assumed the user to be
            able to focus on their current workout and to be able to quickly know the information rather than read
            the screen content in detail, while effectively minimizing false touches. That&#39;s why I allocated
            most of the screen space to video, and also included an eye-catching progress bar and larger
            buttons.</p>

          <p>The dialogue page follows the user&#39;s intuition and includes buttons to jump to the fitness plan
            page to reduce the number of screen taps. A text-to-speech playback button has been added to help users
            focus on fitness.</p>
