          <!--<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
          <p>Ferrous is an extraordinary adventure puzzle game that immerses players in a world where magnetism
            reigns supreme. With its captivating gameplay mechanics, intricately designed levels, and an array
            of challenges that evolve in complexity, it promises an unforgettable journey that hinges on the
            creative use of magnetic abilities in an ever-expanding and visually stunning world. Get ready to
            unleash your magnetic potential and embark on a thrilling robotic adventure like no other.
          </p>
          <h5 id="key-feature">Key Feature</h5>
          <p>A key feature of the game lies in the ingenious ways players can employ their magnetic prowess to
            interact with the environment. In this magnetic adventure, players can effortlessly attract (pull)
            or repel (push) these objects to surmount obstacles, explore the surroundings, and advance through a
            multitude of meticulously designed levels.</p>
          <h5 id="problem1">Problem during development 1</h5>
          <p>During the process, the biggest challenge revolved around code merging, leading to dysfunction and
            confusion in the game scenes. This culminated in a broken scenario, preventing us from presenting at the
            Game Design & Development Club's testing session.</p>
          <h5 id="solution1">Solution</h5>
          <p>In response, I advocated for a comprehensive review of our content, taking the lead in discussions. I
            proposed to establishing a standardized process for task assignment and code merging. Our approach involved
            splitting tasks into modules, ensuring one person worked on game scenarios at a time, while others focused
            on different, non-intersecting code modules such as UI, Gameplay, and SFX, allowing parallel coding.
            Meanwhile, there is also a "blocked" section to check out blocked tasks so that we can help on the team
            member together. Trello was employed for task allocation across modules, providing clarity on each
            teammate's responsibilities.</p>
          <p><img src="/projects/Ferrous/Image/mergeprocess.png" style="zoom:33%; max-width: 70%;" /></p>
          <h5 id="problem2">Problem during development 2</h5>
          <p>During development, we often need to reuss scripts. If a script is responsible for fixed
            inputs and fixed outputs, then it can be easily applied. However, if a script usually receives different
            inputs and triggers different outputs, but its core detection content is the same, and we still apply the
            previous script to hard-code it, it will generate a lot of redundancy. This problem was not emphasized in
            the early stages of our development, which made it necessary for the programmers to copy and rewrite the
            same script every time there was a new level design. This move wasted a lot of our time and caused us to do
            a lot of redundant communication.</p>
          <h5 id="solution2">Solution</h5>
          <p>So, I proposed refactoring the scripts at a later stage and using unityevent. for example, in this example
            of detecting the opening of a door, the developer can now pass the script that opens the door by inheriting
            from the baseswitch class and then modifying the onactive property. In the script that detects when the
            level is reached, it can take any number of switch inputs so that we can customize the level as we like. At
            the same time, we can also customize the output at will, such as opening doors, triggering organs, etc.,
            which saves us a lot of time.</p>

            <li>Design detail hints to guide players to utilise skills rather than confuse them</li>
            <li>Player feedback and playtests are very important to point out the shortcomings of the game and
              help improve it</li>
            <li>The use of the task planning system Trello facilitates the development process to a great
