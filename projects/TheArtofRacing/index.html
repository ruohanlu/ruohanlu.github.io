          <p><strong>Welcome to the world of speeeed!</strong></p>
          <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/mainPanel.png" alt="game-flow"

          <p><strong>The Art of Racing</strong> is a racing game with a knowledge popularizing focus.
            The player assumes the role of a driver, an up-and-coming driver who is eager to improve his driving
            skills. He will learn about racing safety devices in the process, be motivated by the game, and learn the
            development of racing.</p>
          <h4 id="what-are-we-doing">What am I doing</h4>
          <h5 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h5>
          <p>Today, racing cars are safer and more maneuverable than ever before. However, many people still perceive
            the
            sport as risky. In response, I developed this game to demonstrate that racinge is actually a safe
            sport, and that numerous drivers have dedicated their lives to promoting safety measures in the sport.
          </p>
          <p>Also, the game honours the memory of Henry Surtees, a driver, and gives thanks for the presence of the
            Halo, which protected the precious lives of drivers such as Zhou Guanyu.</p>
          <h6 id="advantages-of-game-media">Advantages of Game Media </h6>
          <p>The game takes advantage of the ease of operation, interactivity, low cost, and ability to highly
            recreate situations to allow players to make their own judgments and choices of the most suitable safety
            components that help them to race better.</p>
          <h5 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h5>
          <h6 id="main-goal">Main Goal</h6>
          <p>The primary objective of this game is to drive skillfully and avoid collisions. The ultimate aim is
            to increase one&#39;s score, earn safety credits, and attain the prestigious title of &quot;Racing
            Artist.&quot;</p>
          <h6 id="level-design">Level Design</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Endless Mode</p>
              <ul>
                <li>In Endless mode, players will have the opportunity to apply their racing knowledge and choose
                  their equipment wisely. In the process, players will be able to use what they have learned
                  to avoid or meet challenges on the track with safety devices.</li>
                <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/endlessMode.png" alt="game-flow"

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Pure-driving Mode</p>
              <ul>
                <li>In the Pure-driving mode, the player is left alone, unprotected by any safety
                  measures, to face the dangers of the track at any time.
                </li>
                <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/pureDrivingMode.png" alt="game-flow"

          </ul>

          <h6 id="game-art">Game Art</h6>
          <p>I myself have always been a fan of low-poly style. Using a low-poly style allows independent game
            developers to use low-mesh polygon while presenting amazing visual effects. So I preferred to apply
            a low-poly style onto this game. </p>
          <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/artStyle.png" alt="art-style"
              style="zoom:100%; max-width: 50%;" /></p>
          <h6 id="game-process">Game Process</h6>
          <p>Starting from the main interface, players are able to easily understand the corresponding content of
            each board through the help button, the specific content of each board is as follows.</p>
          <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/gameFlow.png" alt="game-flow"
              style="zoom:100%; max-width: 70%;" /></p>
          <p>In the Temple of Speed section, players can participate in a real race through Endless Mode and
            Pure-driving Mode.</p>
          <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/TOS.png" alt="game-flow" style="zoom:100%; max-width: 50%;" /></p>
          <p>The Institute of Mechanics section of the game is where players can learn about the various safety
            components used in Formula One cars, including their design, function, and how they are tested.
          </p>
          <p><img src="/projects/TheArtofRacing/image/IOM.png" alt="game-flow" style="zoom:100%; max-width: 50%;" /></p>
          <p>The About History section provides players with a historical overview of the evolution of safety
            measures in Formula One.</p>
          <p>The About Safety Component section focuses on how safety components work and how they can help
            players achieve better results in the Endless and Pure-driving modes of the game. </p>
          <p>In the Mechanic Training section, players will face a challenge to test their knowledge of Formula
            One safety components.</p>
          <h4 id="production-process">Production Process</h4>
          <h6 id="game-prototype-testing">Game prototype testing</h6>
          <p>The test was performed as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Detailed testing of each collision for normalization</li>
            <li>Pushing race cars into Tboundary conditions to test the problem</li>
            <li>Detect accidental player inputs to detect accidental game bugs.</li>
            <li>Check the game&#39;s performance on various devices and screen resolutions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I found several issues to fix:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Vehicles can make unlimited turns without restrictions, which means players can turn around and
              drive backward</li>
            <li>Name changes are not recorded in a file, which means that players will lose their previous name
              changes the next time they log in to the game.</li>
          </ul>
          <h6 id="game-iteration">Game Iteration</h6>
          <p>After completing the first version of the game, I ran a player test and got some feedback from
            players:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>UI is quite intuitive</li>
            <li>Expanding the camera field of view to see more obstacles</li>
            <li>Modified vehicle speed so that players can better deal with obstacles</li>
            <li>Increase the richness of the scenarios</li>
            <li>Modify the name change function so that players can discard and return if they don&#39;t want to
              change their name.</li>
            <li>Add some feedback when players hit obstacles</li>

          </ul>
          <h6 id="what-i-learned">What did I learn?</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>How to make a game from 0 to 1.</li>
            <li>How to design the levels of a game, and make use of limited assets to make an infinite game
              level.</li>
            <li>How to make art resources for a game.</li>
            <li>How to test the game in detail and conduct user experience research to improve the game.</li>
