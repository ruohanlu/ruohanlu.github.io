          <p>Aqua&#39;s Will is a 6 students' program at Shanghai University. By creating a single-player game, our goal
            is to make
            people realize the importance of protecting the environment with a compelling backstory and detailed
            action.</p>

            <h5 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Today, 40 percent of the world&#39;s oceans are severely impacted by humans, and more than half of
              the coastal habitats are being degraded. As humans enjoy the natural gifts of the ocean, we must remember
              the pain that the ocean has experienced.
              Thus, We created an ocean-themed game and hoped to use it to bring people into a marine life perspective.
            </p>
            <h5 id="my-duty">My Duty</h5>
            <p>As the lead programmer and designer on the team, my responsibilities include building scene
              interactions, writing enemy AI to bring this game world to life and design game level and mechanics.</p>
            <h5 id="introductory-scene">Introductory Scene</h5>
            <p>The gameplay experience begins with an introductory scene that invites the player into Aqua&#39;s
              world with a story opening. Through on-screen transitions, the player becomes Aqua and embarks on a
              quest to save his friends.</p>

            <h5 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h5>
            <h6 id="main-character">Main Character</h6>
            <p>Players take on the role of Aqua, a sea spirit, and use their skills to pass through various
              obstacles and travel to the deepest part of the ocean to purify the mutated whale sharks.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Aqua is the messenger of the ocean, so the level of pollution in the ocean is closely related
                  to Aqua, who has an oxygen bar and a pollution bar, which will produce different results through
                  different interactions with the surrounding environment:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the dark, oxygen-free dead zone the oxygen bar decreases, the oxygen bar decreases to
                    zero, and the game ends.</li>
                  <li>The Pollution Bar increases over time and increases dramatically when the Sea Spirit touches
                    an oil or trash drop, is touched by an enemy, or is attacked by an enemy. Once the pollution
                    bar is full, the game ends.</li>
                  <li>If Aqua is hit by a falling rock, falls into a giant vortex, or is struck by a spiked
                    wolfsbane, the game is over.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6 id="game-scene-design-iteration">Game Scene Design Iteration</h6>
            <p>At first, our team designed the following map, then we gradually added all kinds of organs and
              traps in the map, and built TileMap for user testing, then, we encountered problems:</p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/mapIteration.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
            <p><strong>Problem</strong>: In the initial map design, we created a vast and intricate
              world. However, during user testing, a player raised a critical issue - the immense open spaces made it
              difficult to find the path to the final boss. At the same time, players responded that they didn&#39;t
              know what the organs on the road were and how those organs worked on the players.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: First, we restructured certain areas of the map, breaking down the larger open
              spaces into
              more manageable sections connected by well-defined pathways. This not only facilitated easier navigation
              but also enhanced the overall flow of gameplay.</p>
            <p>Then, we added visual cues, landmarks, and defined pathways to
              guide players while revising the grand scale of the environment. </p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/visualCues.png" style="zoom:33%;" /></p>
            <p>After this improvement, there was a noticeable increase in player ratings of the maps, which they
              felt were helpful in helping them understand the map&#39;s content and complete the flow of the game.
            </p>
            <p>Here&#39;s the iteration of final map:</p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/finalMap.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
            <h6 id="customized-enemy-ai-system">Customized Enemy AI System</h6>
            <p><strong>Problem</strong>: When creating a platform-adventure game, one of the primary concerns is
              designing the enemy AI
              system.</p>
            <p>Initially, we use simple conditional judgements to make enemies,
              which offered basic functionalities for patrolling, detecting the player, and engaging in combat.
              However, we encountered a significant challenge in achieving the desired level of complexity and
              intelligence in enemy behavior. Additionally, as our game heavily relies on the AI to provide dynamic
              and immersive gameplay experiences, we found it necessary to explore the development of a custom AI
              system to meet our specific requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution</strong>: To overcome these challenges, I studied the following ways to compose an enemy
              AI.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Conditional judgment</li>
              <li>Finite state machines</li>
              <li>Behaviour Tree</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After weighing the pros and the cons, I chose to customize the state machine to complete the writing of
              the enemy
              (specifically the Boss) AI. By calculating the state and position of the boss and the position of the
              player, the boss can &quot;intelligently&quot; track the player and make it more difficult for the
              player to hit the boss. In addition, our AI takes into account the collision system, so that when the
              player tries to get close to the boss, the boss will unleash the collision skill, so that the player
              will have to stay at a certain distance to fight the boss.
              I was responsible for the development of the entire state machine. After implementing the system and
              conducting several tests, we achieved remarkable results. The illustration shows the state description
              of the Boss.
            </p>
            <p><img src="/projects/AquaWill/image/bossStatus.png" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
            <p>Boss can achieve functions are as follows: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The boss can automatically follow the protagonist; </li>
              <li>The boss model has a total of four actions: Idle (Idle) Run (Run) Attack (Attack) Death (Death)
                Impact (Smash); </li>
              <li>The boss can respond to player's different action. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case the state machine can be subdivided into: the state machine system, the state base class,
              and the actual script mounted on the object. First, the different states are written using inherited state
              base classes, then the state machine system is called to control the state methods, and then the
              individual states are added by registering events in the actual script on the object.
